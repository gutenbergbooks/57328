<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The great variety of useful little books lately
published, under such titles as <cite>Daily Food</cite>, <cite>Daily
Crumbs</cite>, <cite>Devout Exercises</cite>, &amp;c. and the favour
with which these have been met, suggested to
the compiler, the utility of attempting something
of the same kind. He had accidentally
met with a little work, called, “Directions,” &amp;c.
published by <i>Maltbys</i>, New Haven; and though
there were some things in it which he did not
like, he thought it, on the whole, a very valuable
little manual of instruction. The compiler
has made such alterations as seemed necessary
to make it please himself, and added some few
particulars from a valuable tract of the late
President Edwards.—The Letter to a young
Lady, &amp;c. is one which the compiler has been
in the habit of presenting to young persons
under certain states of mind; and the “Memento,”
by whomsoever prepared, is most admirably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
done, and worthy to be read by all
Christians.—The article on the question, “Am
I a New Creature?” taken from the Spirit of the
Pilgrims, is one highly useful and important in
the present period of religious inquiry.</p>

<p>The sole object of the compiler is to do good;
and this he trusts and prays may be accomplished.</p>

<h1>WAY MARKS.</h1>

<h2 id="DIRECTIONS">DIRECTIONS TO PERSONS COMMENCING A
RELIGIOUS LIFE.</h2>

<p>1. Remember that the commencement
of the Christian life is to be like the
“dawning light, which increaseth more
and more to the perfect day.” Therefore
when the hope of peace and pardon dawns
in the heart, do not consider the great
business of life as <em>accomplished</em>, but only
as <em>begun</em>.</p>

<p>2. Keep up as great a strife and earnestness
in religion, as if you knew yourself
to be in a state of nature. When
persons are under conviction of sin, they
are advised to be earnest and violent for
the kingdom of heaven. You ought not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to be less in earnest now, if you wish not
to lose a sweet and lively sense of spiritual
things.</p>

<p>3. Do not cease to strive and pray for
the very same things which you sought
before you had reason to hope you were
converted. Those who have most light
and most grace, have, nevertheless, need
of more. There are very few requests
that are proper for an impenitent sinner,
that are not proper for one who professes
godliness. At any rate, the mistake will
do you no harm.</p>

<p>4. Evidence of piety is not so much to
be sought in <em>high emotions</em> of any kind,
as in real humility—self-distrust—hungering
and thirsting after righteousness,
sorrow for sin, and a <em>continual effort</em>, in
every day life, to regulate our thoughts,
feelings, and conduct by the word of God.
It is the <em>nature</em> and not the <em>degree</em> of our
affections, which is to be regarded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
examination of our evidences. The best
way to know our feelings is, to see how
they influence the <em>conduct</em>. “By their
fruit ye shall know them.” Always look
upon those as the best <em>comforts</em>, which
have most of these two effects—those that
make you least and lowest and most like
a child, and those that most determine
you to deny yourself, and to spend and
be spent in the service of your Master.</p>

<p>5. Do not expect to find in your own
case, every thing you have heard or read
of in the experience of others. For it may
be that many things we hear and read of,
are not correct feelings, and do not afford
just grounds of confidence to any one;
and if they are <em>correct</em> experience, it may
be the experience of a <em>mature</em> Christian,
and not to be expected in the beginning
of a religious life. It must be remembered,
that as no two countenances are formed
alike, so no two hearts are fashioned alike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
or placed in exactly the same circumstances;
and it would be as vain to seek
all the varieties of Christian experience
in one person, as to seek all varieties of
human features in one face.</p>

<p>6. Do not expect that the evidence desired
will all come immediately and at
once. It will be most likely to come <em>progressively</em>,
as the result of continued effort
in obedience to the will of God.</p>

<p>7. Do not suppose that religion is a
principle of such <em>self-preserving</em> energy,
as that when once implanted in the soul
it will continue to thrive and increase
without effort. The plant of divine grace
can no more thrive without care, and diligent
and patient cultivation, than can those
rare and valued plants, that demand the
physical efforts and culture of man.</p>

<p>God will not sustain and bring to maturity
the work of grace, without your
own voluntary concurrence in the diligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
use of means. He will not do it any more
than he would cause the harvest to whiten
in the field of the sluggard. Indulge,
therefore, no such ideas of <em>inability and
dependence</em> on God, as shall impair a full
sense of perfect obligation to do whatever
<em>can be done</em> in working out your own
salvation. God never promises to assist
any but those who make efforts to aid
and advance themselves.</p>

<p>8. Entertain no such ideas of the sovereignty
of God in the bestowment of his
grace, as would awaken any doubt of his
affording needful aid, where he sees sincere
endeavours to grow in grace. If some
christians are more eminent than others,
it is simply because they <em>make more
efforts</em> to be so, and God aids these efforts.
So that all worldly minded and indifferent
christians continue in this state, because
they do not choose to make efforts to get
out of it. Any person can be an eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
christian that chooses to be so. Christians
are too apt to feel as if eminence in
piety was a distinction made by the
sovereignty of God, and to suppose that
high attainments are not within the reach
of all, and that languid and inefficient piety
is the result of divine sovereignty rather
than negligence and sloth. A more false
or more pernicious opinion cannot easily be
adopted by Christians. The truth is, that
the road to eminence in gifts and graces,
and the means of obtaining them, are open
to all who seek them, and if any do not
attain them; it is owing to their own sloth
and inefficiency, and not to any deficiency
on the part of God in blessing <em>diligent</em>
efforts. It always pleases him to crown
with success the hand of the diligent
instead of the hand of the slothful, not
only in temporal but in spiritual things.
This thought cannot be too strongly impressed
upon the minds of those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
just commencing the christian life. To
them <em>peculiarly</em>, are such promises as these
directed; “Ask, and ye shall receive, seek
and ye shall find, knock and it shall be
opened unto you. <em>Every one</em> that asketh
receiveth,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid of indulging in feelings
which may seem to be right, from
the fear of deception. On the contrary,
cherish such feelings and try to recall
them often. Go forward and <em>do your
duty</em>, and God will save you from deception
while thus employed.</p>

<p>10. There is one caution which is
peculiarly needful to those who have been
greatly interested in the subject of religion,
and that is, to <em>take particular care of the
health</em>.</p>

<p>There is such a mysterious and intimate
connection between the mind and
body, that one cannot be wearied or suffer,
without affecting the other. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mind is fatigued and exhausted, it affects
the body, and this again reacts on the
mind.</p>

<p>Every person ought to be aware, that
the more anxiously and intensely the
mind is interested on any subject, the
greater is the need of <em>exercise</em>, <em>sleep</em> and
<em>frequent relaxation</em>. Attention to religion,
does not demand that <em>all</em> lawful business
be suspended, and forbids the neglect of
all needful rest and exercise; but be very
cautious here, lest you mistake <em>negligence</em>
in religion, for a necessary attention to the
health.</p>

<p>11. Do not expect to be made very
happy by religion, unless you become
<em>eminent</em> christians. A <em>half way</em> christian
can neither enjoy the pleasures of the
world nor the pleasures of religion; for
his conscience will not let him seek the
one, and he is too indolent to obtain the
other. The christian may be the happiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
man on earth, but he must be a faithful,
active, and devoted christian. None are
disappointed in finding religion a source
of unfailing peace and joy, but those who
refuse to drink deep of the wells of salvation;
unless we except those who, from
some derangement of the nervous system,
or failure of health, do not enjoy the clear
and undisturbed exercise of their faculties.
A healthy mind in a healthy body,
may always be made happy by religion.</p>

<p>12. Do not look at the practice and example
of <em>other</em> christians, in forming the
standard of piety at which you aim. The
allowance of this thing, has probably had
a more disastrous influence on the church
and on the world, than all other causes
that could be named. Generally, when
persons commence a christian life, their
consciences are susceptible and tender.
They are strict and watchful in the performance
of duty, and are pained even by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a slight neglect. They have been wont
to feel, that becoming religious implies a
<em>great</em> change; that “old things must pass
away and <em>all things</em> become new.” But
when they begin to look around among
their christian friends, and turn to them
for aid, and those who have had experience
and have made advances in christian
life, they find that <em>they</em> seem to look
upon duties and deficiencies in a very
different manner. <em>They</em> seem to neglect
many things which the young christian
has felt to be very important; and to
practice many things which he had supposed
inconsistent with religion. <em>Then
commences the disastrous effect.</em> The
young christian begins to feel that he
need not be more particular than those to
whom he has ever looked up with deference
and respect. He begins to imagine
that he has been rather <em>too strict</em> and
particular. He begins to take a retrograde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
course, and though his conscience
and the bible often check and reprove, yet
after a few inefficient struggles, he lowers
his standard and walks as others do.</p>

<p>Look into your bible and see how christians
ought to live. See how the bible
says those who are christians <em>must</em> live,
and then if you find your christian friends
living in a <em>different</em> way, instead of having
cause for feeling that you may do so
too, you have only cause to fear that
they are deceiving themselves with the
belief that they are christians, when they
are not. Remember that the farther your
christian friends depart from the standard
of christian character laid down in the
bible, the less reason have you to hope
that they <em>are</em> christians. And do not
hesitate on this subject because you find
<em>many</em> professed christians, who are indifferent
and lax in their practice and example.
Remember that Christ has said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“<em>Many</em> shall say unto me in that day,
Lord, Lord,” thus claiming to be his disciples,
to whom he will say, “I never
knew you.” Do not let <em>professed</em> christians
tempt you to fall into the society of
such unhappy <em>castaways</em>.</p>

<p>13. Do not be <em>periodical</em> christians.
There are some who profess religion, who
never seem to feel any interest on the
subject, except when every one else does.
It is true, there are special seasons of revived
religion in the hearts of all christians,
but if it is only at such times that
progress is made in divine life, and interest
is manifested in the salvation of souls,
there is great reason to fear that what is
called religion is nothing but sympathy
with the feelings of others.</p>

<p>14. Do not let the adversaries of the
cross have occasion to reproach religion
on your account. How holily should the
children of God, the redeemed and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
beloved of the Son of God, behave themselves.
Therefore, “walk as children of
the light, and of the day,” and “adorn
the doctrine of God your Saviour;” and
especially, abound in what are called the
Christian virtues, and make you like the
Lamb of God: be meek and lowly of
heart, and full of pure, heavenly, and
humble love to all; abound in deeds of
love to others, and self-denial for others;
and let there be in you a disposition to
account others better than yourself.</p>

<p>15. Be sure that there exists a <em>marked
difference</em> between <em>your</em> appearance and
conduct, and that of those who are not
christians. Remember that Christ has
required this of you, and that even <em>the
world</em> expects it.</p>

<p>16. Do not suppose you can recommend
religion, by appearing interested in every
thing that interests those who have no
better portion than this world.—Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that your deportment, your conversation;
your interest in dress, in company and
amusements; the manner in which you
perform your religious duties, are all carefully
noted and weighed by those around
you, who do not love religion; and if
they do not see a <em>marked difference</em> between
you and themselves, they either
conclude there is nothing in religion, or
else that you are a hypocrite. Worldlings
<em>expect</em> that you will be <em>very</em> different from
them, and <em>despise</em> you in their hearts if
you are not. If you wish to recommend
religion, let the world see it acted out according
to the beautiful pattern laid down
in the bible, and do not suppose that you
can improve this pattern by any addition
or subtraction of your own. On one
subject there are some who need instruction.
There is a class of christians who
appear taciturn, unsocial, and even sad.
This appearance is altogether inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with the spirit of religion. Christians
ought to appear cheerful and happy; to
appear to receive with pleasure and gratitude
all the lawful enjoyments bestowed
by their Heavenly Father. Such a gloomy
deportment as has been described, does
not do honour to religion, and causes those
whom we wish to win to the ways of
pleasantness and peace, to feel that religion
is a melancholy, unsocial, and forbidding
subject.</p>

<p>All professors of religion should endeavour
to have such views of God, his love,
his providence, his care; and should so
live, as to <em>be</em> cheerful and happy, and to
<em>appear</em> so.</p>

<p>On the contrary, there is a class of professed
christians, who indulge in frequent
trifling and levity. This is quite as inconsistent
and injurious as the former,
and if any thing it is more so. Let the
<em>christian</em> at least, learn to make a distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
between <em>cheerfulness</em> and <em>levity</em>.
Remember we are commanded to avoid
<em>foolish talking and jesting</em>, and that it
is possible to be happy, cheerful, affable,
and kind without any trifling or levity.</p>

<p>17. Remember that your evidence of
possessing religion <em>ceases</em> when <em>any thing
else</em> has the <em>first</em> place in your thoughts
and interests.</p>

<p>Religion should not lessen our love for
our friends, or our real enjoyments; but
<em>the desire to please God in all our ways</em>
should be the <em>prevailing feeling</em> of the
mind. Our Saviour says, we cannot have
<em>two masters</em>; <em>God and his service</em> must
be first in our thoughts and affections, or
else the <em>world and its pleasures</em> are first.
If then we would find whose servants
we are, we must find who has the first
place in our thoughts and affections.</p>

<p>18. Never for <em>one day</em> omit to read the
bible with prayer. This is a most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
direction. It is of the utmost
importance that you should never <em>for
once</em> break over this habit. Prayer and
the bible are your anchor and your
shield, which will hold you firmly in
the path of duty, and protect you from
temptation. You had better give up one
meal every day, if it is necessary, in order
to secure time for this duty. You had
better give up any thing else. <em>Nothing
is a duty</em>, if the performance of it will
interfere with this duty. Remember this
is the bread of your life, and the water of
your salvation; and that you cannot live
in health a single day, without their
strengthening and invigorating influence.</p>

<p>19. Be regulated by a principle of duty
in <em>little things</em>. This is the way that
common christians are to cause their light
to shine. Few christians can expect to
do any <em>great</em> things to show their love
for the Saviour, but all can “deny themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and thus daily take the cross and
follow him.” Religion should govern the
temper and the tongue; should save us
from indolence, from vanity, from pride,
from foolishness, from levity, from moroseness,
from selfishness, and all the little
every day foibles to which we are exposed.
Religion should exemplify its gentleness
in your kind and affable manners; its
purity and propriety in your conversation;
its benevolence in your conduct, and its
consistency and heavenly tendency, in all
your ways.</p>

<p>20. It is a most excellent method to go
to some sincere and candid friend, and
inquire what are your own defects in
temper, character, and every day deportment,
and when you have discovered
these, make it the object of your prayers
and efforts to correct them.</p>

<p>21. One thing ought to be strictly regulated
by principle, and that is the <em>employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of time</em>. Always feel that you
are doing wrong when your time is passing
unprofitably. Have some <em>regularity
of method</em> on this subject. Endeavour to
ascertain how much time should be devoted
to your friends and to relaxation, and
to let the remainder be <em>all of it</em> employed
in the most useful manner you can devise.
Never be satisfied with the manner in
which you are spending your time, if you
can think of any possible way in which
it might be more usefully employed.</p>

<p>Remember that <em>time</em> is the precious talent
for which you must account to God;
and if you find yourselves indulging in
listless inactivity, or tempted to engage in
employments of no practical use, <em>remember
your account to God</em>. <em>Be in a habit</em>
of inquiring when you commence any
employment, “Is there any thing I can
do, more useful than this?” And do not
be satisfied till you have settled the question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that you are doing all the good you
can.</p>

<p>22. Attempt by your efforts and example,
to raise the standard of piety and activity.
If all who are now commencing
the Christian life, should make this an
object, and not fall into the temptation
which professed christians so often set
before the lambs of the flock, the church
would indeed soon rise before the world,
“fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and
terrible as an army with banners.”</p>

<p>Resolve to be an example to those who
ought to be an example to you, and take
the bible, and the <em>bible only</em>, for your
guide in forming christian character.</p>

<p>23. Be active in promoting all benevolent
objects. Make it an object to prepare
to lead with propriety in all social devotional
duties. At this period, when
prayer and effort must unite in hastening
the great day of the Lord, let every young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
christian learn to guide the devotions
of others, as well as to lift up his own
private supplication. There is nothing
which so much promotes the “brotherly
love,” required in the bible, and nothing
which so much promotes union of effort
and interest, as social prayer: and every
one who commences religious life, should
aim to be prepared to perform such duties
with propriety; and should stimulate
others to engage in them.</p>

<p>24. Do not hesitate in the performance
of all the <em>external</em> duties of a christian,
because you do not find satisfactory evidence
that your <em>feelings</em> are right.</p>

<p>Religious duty consists of two parts—feeling
and action,—and because we find
great deficiency in one respect, we surely
ought not to neglect the whole. It is as
unreasonable, as it would be, not to attempt
to <em>feel right</em> till every <em>external</em>
duty was perfectly performed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
If we are dissatisfied with our evidence,
let us go on and <em>do</em> every thing that a
christian should do, as the most hopeful
way to <em>produce</em> right <em>feelings</em>. We surely
cannot hope to bring our hearts right by
neglecting our outward duties.</p>

<p>Go forward then, and take a stand as
an <em>active</em> christian, and if your hearts
are not right with God, you may be sure
you are in less danger in taking this
course than in neglecting it.</p>

<p>25. Under special difficulties, or when
in great need of, or great longings after,
any particular mercy, for yourself or
others, set apart a day for secret prayer
and fasting by yourself alone; and let
the day be spent, not only in petitions
for the mercies you desire, but in searching
your heart, and in looking over your past
life, and confessing your sins before God,
not as is wont to be done in public prayer,
but by a very particular rehearsal, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
God, of the sins of your past life, from
your childhood hitherto, before and after
conversion, with the circumstances and
aggravations attending them, spreading
all the abominations of your heart, very
particularly, and fully as possible, before
him.</p>

<p>26. Remember that the principal duty
of a christian, as it respects others, is to
excite them to the <em>immediate performance</em>
of their religious duty.</p>

<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ appears to have
intended that through the instrumentality
of Christians, the perishing may be saved.
There is no christian but can find some
<em>one</em> mind at least, over which he can have
some influence; and if we can do <em>any
thing</em> to save others from eternal death,
nothing should for a moment prevent our
attempting it.</p>

<p>But to perform our duty faithfully in
this respect, requires both discretion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
some knowledge derived from the experience
of others. The following hints,
therefore, are added as the result of long
experience and observation, and as a sort
of guide to those who may be anxious to
save a soul from death.</p>

<p>Let your <em>first</em> object be to persuade
your friend to give an earnest and immediate
attention to the subject. Serious
remarks upon religion, do not produce
much effect, unless some <em>direct object</em> is
had in view.</p>

<p>Urge the immediate duty of giving the
affections of the heart to God. Show
them that if they will only love God, they
will then feel their guilt in refusing to
obey him, and will greatly desire to live
for his glory. If they will only love their
God and Saviour, they will feel that they
can trust in the merits of his atoning
blood. Do not, for a moment, allow them
to feel that performing the outward duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of religion, is doing any thing to recommend
them to God, but is only a <em>means</em>
of making them feel more deeply their
immediate obligation to give the affections
of their hearts to him, and of realizing
the reasonableness of his holy law which
requires it. Speak to them as if you really
<em>felt</em> that there was no need of any
delay, but that they could immediately
perform what God requires; and in order
to do this, endeavour to have a deep
and realizing sense of this truth yourself.
If they complain of their inability, or of
the difficulty they find in performing their
duty, show them that it is because they
have so long forgotten and neglected God,
that though it has really become difficult, it
is a difficulty they have made for themselves,
and which is an addition to their
guilt. Show them that whatever the difficulty
is, they can overcome it; for God
never requires of his creatures, what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
cannot perform, and his standing unalterable
law is, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy heart.” Remember always
that the more clearly, constantly, and
forcibly the truth is presented to any mind
that will attend to it, the more hope there
is that it will be obeyed.</p>

<p>One caution however, needs to be added,
and that is, that when it becomes apparent
that the mind <em>will not</em> be brought
to attend to the subject; when you find
that the efforts become wearisome and
unpleasant, always <em>cease for a while</em>, and
wait for another time, or else you will do
more harm than good. Persevering after
this will only affect their minds with
disgust and aversion towards a subject to
which they have resolved they will not
attend.</p>

<p>Another caution is also important.
Always <em>speak kindly and affectionately</em>
to friends upon this subject; and if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
find all your efforts vain, though you
cease to urge neglected duty, still continue
to express the same kindness and interest
for them. Do not give them occasion
to feel that, because they will not take
your advice, you have cast them off as
reprobates, and no longer desire their society.
We may still continue to love the
amiable natural traits of our friends, even
though we find that they refuse to have
them crowned and beautified by religion.
Let all your efforts for the good of others
be accompanied by earnest and constant
prayer.</p>

<p>Lastly, do not be discouraged because
you find that you are <em>very deficient in
any of the particulars specified</em>.</p>

<p>Remember, that Christian life is a <em>warfare</em>,
and that it is only at the <em>end</em> that
we are to come off conquerors and more
than conquerors. Remember, that He
whom you are striving to serve and please,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
is not a hard master. Though you have
been inexcusable in fostering habits of
neglect, and all the difficulties you find
are of your own making, yet he can be
“touched with the feeling of your infirmities.”
When he sees that you really
are afflicted because you are so constantly
tempted to forget him, he pities you “as
a father pitieth his children;” and so long
as you see the means he has appointed to
keep you from sin, and wait upon him
for strength and guidance, he will never
leave nor forsake you. When you feel
your own strength and resolution failing,
go to him who hath said, “my grace is
sufficient for thee, and my strength shall
be made perfect in weakness.” Call upon
him, “and he will be very gracious unto
the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear
it, he will answer thee. And thine ears
shall hear a word behind thee, saying,
this is the way, walk ye therein, when ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
turn to the right and when ye turn to
the left.” Remember also, that the conflict
is short; the race will speedily be
accomplished—soon your deficiencies and
guilt shall pain you no more—soon you
shall “see him as he is,” and “awake in
his likeness and be satisfied therewith.”</p>

<h2 id="LETTER">LETTER<br />
<span class="smaller">TO A YOUNG LADY AT THE OUTSET OF A
RELIGIOUS LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>My dear young Friend,—As your
mind becomes more enlightened in the
knowledge of divine things, I am sure
you will ever find fresh cause to wonder
at the goodness of God. The contemplation
of his character is a theme of
never-ending delight; and in proportion
as we discover our own worthlessness and
guilt, we shall likewise have the brighter
manifestations of his unspeakable excellence.
And it is most profitable to cultivate
such inquiries; for, the more we are
impressed with the infinite holiness and
purity of God, our hatred to sin will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
increase. This, again, directly leads to
the promotion of genuine humility, and
lively gratitude, and unfeigned piety.
We are humbled to the dust when we
think of “the rock from whence we are
hewn;” that we are the apostate children
of apostate parents: still more so when we
feel the awful aggravation of our guilt, in
having wilfully forsaken and estranged
ourselves from a God, whose peculiar characteristic
is love; a God, who, in spite
of all our rebellions against his authority,
and all our violations of his law, and all
our contempt of his gracious warnings,
is yet ready to extend his merciful forgiveness,
and to restore his lost favour to
every penitent and returning sinner. I
have often considered the following passages
from the prophecies of Isaiah, as a
most engaging and encouraging delineation
of Divine goodness; “Therefore will
the Lord wait, that he may be gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
unto you; and therefore will he be exalted,
that he may have mercy upon you.”
The most hardened and abandoned criminal
is often melted into tenderness by
the compassionate sympathy of the person
whom he has offended. He not only
humbly confesses his guilt, but is overwhelmed
with grateful, joyful surprise.
So it frequently happens, when the sinner,
convinced of his guilt, first discovers
that the great God against whom he has
been offending all his life long, is actually
waiting that he may be gracious; and is
exalted on a throne of mercy, as it were,
for the very purpose of dispensing the
blessings of forgiveness. “The goodness
of God leads him to repentance:” and
then, with the most affectionate humility,
at once he leaves off his rebellion, enlists
himself into the service of so kind a Master,
and, with the newly converted Paul,
exclaims, “Lord what wouldest thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
have me to do?” This devoted attachment
kindles into acts of open and decided
piety. He feels his unspeakable obligations
to redeeming love; and these obligations
are ever acquiring fresh strength, as
he grows in a more thorough knowledge
of the “desperate wickedness” of his
own heart: he loves much, because much
has been forgiven.</p>

<p>I doubt not but the workings of your
own experience have some correspondence
with those I have described. You have
now been happily led to flee from the
wrath to come, and to embrace Christ
crucified as all your salvation. But on
the retrospect of former years, does it not
strike you with amazement that God did
not “cut you down as a cumberer of the
ground?” that he did not inflict the awful
curse which your unceasing provocations
had so justly incurred? that he persevered
so long in a course of tender forbearance?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and, above all, that at last he
should fix upon you as a special object of
his clemency, and “pluck you as a brand
from the burning?” You must ascribe
all the change in your condition—the condemnation
from which you are rescued,
and the blessings to which you are exalted—to
the free, unsought, and unmerited
love of God in Christ Jesus. O, my
friend! let the range of your meditations
often run in this direction. It will take
eternity itself to unfold the manifold wisdom,
and the matchless love of God, in
the redemption of your soul; but, O! begin
the work at present, and let the beginning
and the ending of your reflections
and your praise be, “Hear what the Lord
hath done for me.” Delight yourself in
the Lord. It is, indeed, an interesting
employment to think on the glories of his
person, the excellences of his character,
and the wisdom of all his dispensations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
especially in reference to yourself. It
will expand your mind with the most sacred
delight. It will, unconsciously, cultivate
a spirit of prayer and devotion; and
in thus holding communion with God,
you will experience that “fulness of joy,”
which nothing earthly can bestow.</p>

<p>But, alas! methinks I can anticipate
your lamentations. Are you not desirous
of telling me, that through the deceitfulness
of sin, you are often beguiled of
your privileges, and robbed of those spiritual
comforts for which your soul pants?
It is your wish to love God from every
consideration, but especially because he
commended his love towards you, in that,
while you were a sinner, Christ died for
you. It is your wish to live in communion
with your God, and to follow after
that holiness without which no man shall
see his face. But your imaginations are
full of vanity, and your best endeavours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
after heavenly meditation are interrupted
and marred by the frequent intrusion of
evil thoughts. All this may be true
enough in your case; for I firmly believe
it accords with the experience even of the
most advanced Christians. But allow me
to say, that while you thus groan under
the burden of remaining corruption, and
are grieved on account of your natural
aversion to what is good, you have reason
to bless God for making you <em>feel</em> your
proneness to evil, and teaching you that
your <em>entire</em> dependence must be on
his promised grace. At the same time
that you confess and mourn over your
imperfections, are you not powerfully affected
with a sense of the Divine long-suffering,
in bearing with them, and in
even sympathizing with you under them;
and in the readiness with which our gracious
God condescends to help the infirmities,
and supply all the wants of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
people? In short, as you grow in grace,
you will always find growing cause to
humble yourself on account of your manifold
short-comings, and to exalt the Saviour
for the riches of his grace and love,
so freely, so suitably, and so abundantly
conferred. This is the tendency of
the whole gospel dispensation. The sinner
is nothing, and can do nothing.
Christ Jesus is all in all. The blessings
which he died to purchase, and now for
ever lives to bestow, are inestimable in
their nature, infinite in their extent, and
eternal in their duration. O, amazing
boon! And these blessings are offered
without money and without price. They
are a gift, a free gift; the gift of the
great eternal God to the creatures of his
own formation: the gift of the heavenly
Father to children who are unconsciously
upheld by his power, and fed by his
bounty, and loaded with his benefits from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
day to day. What condescension! what
love! And yet, strange to tell, both the
Giver and the gift are alike despised by
blinded, degraded, ungrateful man! This
is a most affecting and humiliating view
of human nature. But is it not a just
one? We cannot look around us without
perceiving innumerable proofs of its
truth. Nor can even the renewed mind
of a Christian free itself from the sad
accusation of undervaluing that great salvation,
which nothing could accomplish
but the incarnation, death, and resurrection
of the Son of God. How then shall
those escape who despise the proffered
mercy? Solemn consideration!</p>

<p>But study you, my dear young friend,
to keep yourself in the love of God.
Live habitually under the influence of
your own unworthiness, and of his unspeakable
goodness. God is love: it is
your duty to love him in return, with <em>all</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
your heart and soul. See that you never
forget what he has done to save you from
everlasting perdition, and to raise you to
glory, and honour, and immortality. Remember
the infinite obligations under
which you are laid; and let it be your
constant aim to walk in his ways, and to
keep his commandments; to serve him
with a willing mind; to glorify him with
your body and your spirit, which are his.
Nor will you ever find that this is a hard
service. On the contrary, the nearer you
live to God, you will enjoy the larger
measure of that “peace which passeth all
understanding.”</p>

<h2 id="MEMENTO_OF_AFFECTION">MEMENTO OF AFFECTION.<br />
<span class="smaller">FROM CHRISTIAN PASTORS, TO THOSE
WHO, UNDER THEIR CARE, HAVE
COMMENCED A RELIGIOUS LIFE:<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCRIPTURES.</span></span></h2>

<p>To them who have obtained like precious
faith with us, through the righteousness
of God and our Saviour Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>We thank our God upon every remembrance
of you, always in every prayer of
ours, making request for you with joy.
Being confident of this very thing, that he
who hath begun a good work in you, will
perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ.
Even as it is meet for us to think this of
you all, because we have you in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
heart. For, ye remember our labour, how
we exhorted, and comforted, and charged,
every one of you, as a father does his
children; and we were with you in weakness,
and in fear, and in much trembling;
and our exhortation was not of deceit,
nor in guile; neither at any time used
we flattering words, as ye know; nor of
men sought we glory, neither of you.
But we were gentle among you, even as
a nurse cherisheth her children; so being
affectionately desirous of you, we were
willing to have imparted unto you, not the
gospel of God only, but our own souls
also, because ye were dear unto us.</p>

<p>Behold what manner of love the Father
hath bestowed upon us, that we should
be called the <em>children of God</em>. For you
hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses
and sins; wherein, in times past,
ye walked according to the course of this
world according to the prince of the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
the children of disobedience; among
whom <em>we all</em> had our conversation in
times past, fulfilling the desires of the
flesh and of the mind, and were by nature
the children of wrath, even as others. But
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love
wherewith he loved us, even when we
were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
with Christ, and hath raised us up
together, and made us sit together in heavenly
places in Christ Jesus. For ye
<em>were</em> as sheep going astray, but now are
returned unto the shepherd and bishop of
your souls.</p>

<p>Be ye therefore followers of God as
dear children, and walk worthy of the
vocation whereby ye are called. For ye
were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
light in the Lord; walk as children of the
light. If then ye be risen with Christ,
seek those things which are above, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
Set your affections on things above, not
on things on the earth. For all that is in
the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust
of the eye, and the pride of life, is not
of the Father, but is of the world. And
the world passeth away, and the lust
thereof; but he that doth the will of God
abideth for ever. And this is the victory
that overcometh the world, even your
faith. Who is he that overcometh the
world, but he that believeth that Jesus is
the Son of God? And Jesus saith, “I
am the way, and the truth, and the life;
no man cometh unto the Father but by
me. If a man love me, he will keep my
commandments, and my father will love
him, and we will come unto him, and
make our abode with him. This is my
commandment, that ye love one another
as I have loved you. Greater love hath
no man than this, that a man lay down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
his life for his friends—Ye are my friends
if ye do whatsoever I command you.” If
God so loved us, we ought also to love one
another. For every one that loveth him
that begat, loveth him also that is begotten
of him. And by this we know that
we love the children of God, when we
love God and keep his commandments.
For <em>this is the love of God</em>, that we <em>keep
his commandments</em>. And we have known
and believed the love which God hath
towards us.—God is love, and he that
dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and
God in him. Know ye not that your
bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost,
which is in you, which ye have of God?
And ye are not your own, but are bought
with a price; therefore glorify God in
your bodies, and in your spirits, which
are his.</p>

<p><em>Search the scriptures</em>, for in them ye
have eternal life. For the entrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that word giveth light, and giveth understanding
to the simple. The law of the
Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the
testimony of the Lord is sure, making
wise the simple; the statutes of the Lord
are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandments
of the Lord are pure, enlightening
the eyes; more to be desired are
they than gold, yea than much fine gold;
sweeter also than honey, and the honey
comb. Let the word of God, therefore,
<em>dwell</em> in you <em>richly</em>, teaching and admonishing
one another, in psalms and
hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with
grace in your heart to the Lord.</p>

<p><em>Pray without ceasing</em>; in <em>every thing</em>,
by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving
let your request be made known to
God. And the peace of God, which
passeth all understanding, shall keep your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><em>But of the times and seasons</em>, ye need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
not that we write unto you, for ye know
Him that hath said, “Remember the sabbath
day to keep it holy. Six days shalt
thou labour and do all thy work, but the
seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy
God.” Blessed is the man that doeth
this, and the son of man that keepeth the
sabbath from polluting it. And if thou
turn away thy foot from the sabbath, and
from doing thy pleasure on my holy day,
and call the sabbath a delight, the holy
of the Lord, honourable, and shall honour
him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding
thine own pleasure, nor speaking
thine own words, then shalt thou delight
thyself in the Lord. Exhort one another
daily while it is called to-day, lest any of
you be hardened through the deceitfulness
of sin; not forsaking the assembling of
yourselves together, as the manner of
some is.</p>

<p><em>Be not conformed to the world</em>, but be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ye transformed by the renewing of your
minds. Lay not up for yourselves treasures
upon earth, where moth and rust
doth corrupt, and where thieves break
through and steal. But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through and steal.
For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also. Love not the world,
neither the things of the world. If any
man love the world, the love of the Father
is not in him. No man can serve
two masters, for either he will hate the
one, and love the other, or else he will
hold to the one, and despise the other.—Ye
cannot serve God and mammon.—Hear
now what the Lord saith; “He
that loveth father or mother more than
me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth
son or daughter more than me, is not
worthy of me; and whosoever doth not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
<em>bear his cross</em> and come after me, cannot
be my disciple.”</p>

<p><em>Beloved, believe not every spirit</em>, but
<em>try</em> the spirits whether they be of God;
for they are not all Israel, that are of Israel;
for many walk, of whom we have
told you often, and now tell you even
weeping, who are enemies of the cross
of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose
glory is their shame, who mind earthly
things. Not every one that saith unto
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven; but he that <em>doeth</em> the will
of my father which is in heaven.—Ye
shall know them by their fruits.</p>

<p>In all things show yourselves a pattern
of good works, that they of a contrary
part may have no evil thing to say of
you. Be not wise in your own conceits,
for God resisteth the proud, but giveth
grace to the humble. For the wisdom
that cometh from above is first pure, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated,
full of mercy and good fruits, without
partiality, and without hypocrisy. Be
kindly affectionate one to another, in honour
preferring one another. Be not
desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
envying one another. How can
ye believe, which receive honour one of
another, and seek not the honour which
cometh from God only. Be content with
such things as ye have, for godliness with
contentment, is great gain. For we
brought nothing into the world, and it is
certain we can carry nothing out, and
having food and raiment, let us be therewith
content. Charge them that are rich
in this world, that they be not high-minded,
nor trust in uncertain riches, but
in the living God, who giveth us richly
all things to enjoy. That they do good,
that they be rich in good works, ready to
distribute, willing to communicate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Let your <em>conversation</em> be as becometh
the gospel of Christ. Let no corrupt communications
proceed out of your mouth;
neither foolish talking nor jesting. Every
idle word that men shall speak, they shall
give an account thereof in the day of judgment;
for by thy words thou shalt be justified,
and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
Speak evil of no man, let your
speech be always with grace, that ye may
know how to answer every man. Bear
ye one another’s burdens; have compassion
one of another, be pitiful, be courteous.
Your adorning, let it not be that
outward adorning of wearing gold, or of
putting on of apparel, but let it be the
hidden man of the heart; even the ornament
of a meek and quiet spirit, which is,
in the sight of God, of great price. And
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
things are lovely, whatsoever things are
of good report, think on these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherefore, let us lay aside every
weight, and the sin which doth so easily
beset us, and let us run with patience, the
race that is set before us. Looking unto
Jesus, the author and the finisher of our
faith, who, for the joy that was set before
him, endured the cross, despising the
shame, and is set down at the right hand
of the throne of God. For ye have not
an High Priest which cannot be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities, but
was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without sin. Who can have compassion
on the ignorant, and on them that
are out of the way, for in that he himself
hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to
succour them that are. Trust in him at
all times; pour out your heart before him;
and he will be very gracious at the voice
of your cry: when he shall hear it, he will
answer. And he will feed his flock like
a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his arms, and carry them in his bosom.
And forget not the exhortation that
speaketh unto you as unto children, “My
son, despise not the chastening of the
Lord, neither faint when thou art rebuked
of him.” For whom the Lord loveth, he
chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth. For our light afflictions,
which are but for a moment, work
out for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory.</p>

<p>For ye are not come to the mount
which might be touched, and that burned
with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness,
and a tempest; but ye are come
unto mount Zion, to the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
innumerable company of angels, to the
general assembly and church of the firstborn,
which are written in heaven, and to
God the judge of all, and to the spirits of
just men made perfect, and to Jesus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mediator of the new covenant, and to the
blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better
things than that of Abel. Having, therefore,
these promises, what manner of persons
ought ye to be in all holy conversation
and godliness.</p>

<p>Therefore, dearly beloved, our joy and
our crown, so stand fast in the Lord, our
dearly beloved. For now we live, if ye
stand fast in the Lord. And what thanks
can we render to God again for you, for
all the joy wherewith we joy for your
sakes, before our God. For what is our
hope, and joy, and crown of rejoicing? are
not even ye in the presence of the Lord?
For the Lord shall descend from heaven
with a shout, with the voice of an archangel,
and with the trump of God. Then
we shall be caught up together to meet
the Lord in the air, and so we shall be
ever with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort
one another with these words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Now unto Him that is able to keep you
from falling, and to present you faultless
before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy; to the only wise God our
Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion
and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>

<h2 id="AM_I_A_NEW_CREATURE">AM I A NEW CREATURE?</h2>

<p>“If any man be in Christ,” says the
Apostle, “he is a new creature.” In the
first part of this sentence it is more than
intimated, that some men are not in
Christ, are not true Christians. Such
was the fact in the days of the Apostle;
such it is now. There still are enemies
to the cross of Christ. There still are
open opposers, decent objectors, and multitudes
thoroughly indifferent to Christ
and heaven, the soul and eternity. We
see them all around us. The world is
full of them. In the straight and narrow
path that leadeth heavenward, only infrequent
prints of the feet of travellers are to
be seen; while the broad road is thronged
by an unnumbered multitude, regardless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
whence they came, and whither they are
going.</p>

<p>The few who have chosen to desert
their companions in folly and sin, and become
Christian pilgrims, in search of a heavenly
city, are called by the Apostle “new
creatures.” This, and other language of similar
import, the sacred writers frequently
employ, to describe a regenerate state, a
transformation from the complete dominion
of sin to the dominion of holiness.
Every truly converted soul is turned from
darkness to light, and from the power of
Satan unto God. This is no eastern allegory,
no oriental fiction, no dream of a
disordered fancy, but the simple statement
of a tremendously important fact—a fact,
which, whether regarded or not, takes fast
hold on the interests of the soul, and the
destinies of eternity.</p>

<p>The new birth, the new creation in
Christ Jesus, regeneration, &amp;c. are words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of strange and unimaginable import to
many minds. And well they may be.
These persons know little about them,
and what little they suppose they know,
is often any thing but truth. They may
talk but they do not understand. They
may fancy, but fancy and fact are seldom
at one.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the mystery which, in
the view of many, hangs over this subject,
to the honest and humble mind it
may be simplified and rendered intelligible;
and this is what I shall now attempt.</p>

<p>The new creation produces no change
in any of our bodily or mental <em>faculties</em>.
The subject of it sees with the same eyes,
hears with the same ears, and labours with
the same hands, which he had before.
Neither is the sight of his literal eye, nor
the hearing of his ear, nor the vigour of
his hand strengthened. The same also
may be said as to any change of his <em>mental</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
faculties. No person, by becoming spiritually
a new creature, receives a new understanding,
or a new imagination, or a
new memory, conscience, or faculty of
choice. His mental faculties may indeed
be invigorated, through the influence of the
Spirit, and by a proper use; still, they are
not essentially changed.—In what, then,
does the great change of which we are
speaking consist? In what respects is the
subject of it a new creature?</p>

<p>Man, in the full extent of his capacities
and affections, possesses something more
than mere organs by which to look abroad
upon the earth, and hear the voice of his
fellow man, and procure subsistence for
his perishing body. He is something
more than a mental being, who can recollect,
and reason, and imagine. He can
wish as well as see; desire as well as
hear; love as well as recollect; hate as
well as reason; choose and refuse as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as imagine. The existence of powers and
faculties, corporeal and mental, is comparatively
a small matter. <em>How are they
employed</em>—is the great question. How
does a man feel? What are his affections?
What are his principles? What
is his practice? These are questions
which go deep into the soul, and discover
what a man is, in the sight of Him who
looketh on the heart, and cannot be deceived.</p>

<p>I say, then, with reference to the point
before us, that the truly regenerate soul
has <em>a new object of supreme affection</em>.</p>

<p>Formerly self was first and last with
him. Morning, noon, and night,—in
youth and manhood, and declining years,—at
home, and abroad, in the church
and in the field, seeking property or bestowing
it on the destitute, in health and
in sickness, in life and in death, the unregenerate
heart pours forth its highest affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
upon self. If it looks upward to
God and abroad to his kingdom, these are
regarded as secondary objects. He cannot
think complacently of God, as ruling
for himself, for the display of his perfections,
for the manifestation of his character,
and as making the impenitent sinner
illustrate that character throughout
the universe and through eternity. Such
thoughts, if they force themselves into
his mind, are unwelcome intruders, and
are banished, as you would drive from
your house a suspected guest, who you
feared would rob you of your treasures,
and deprive you of life. Just so it is with
self. Whatever it suspects as inimical
to its little, paltry ends, it eyes with suspicion
and fixed hostility, and opposes
with all the vigour that sin and Satan can
impart. God, his character, his government,
his perfections, his will,—these are
objects that cross the path and thwart the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
purposes of self. Both cannot be first.
‘Ye will love the one and hate the other.’
This is the irreversible law of man’s moral
nature.—The selfish person may for
a time be ignorant of his selfishness, and
may think himself actuated by noble, generous,
disinterested views; but even
when the wrappers are taken off, and his
true character is revealed, still, he will
continue to love himself. Still, he will
dread and hate the holy character and
government of Jehovah.</p>

<p>But he is a <em>new creature</em>. That Divine
character, once so hateful, is now lovely;
that government once so dreaded, is seen
to be established in wisdom and goodness;
while those perfections, once odious, break
forth and beam out with a heavenly
splendour, the source of joy and of unfailing
confidence to all holy beings. ‘Be
thou exalted, O God, above the heavens.
Let thy glory be above all the earth.’—Truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
this is a great and wonderful
change. ‘Old things have passed away;
all things have become new.’ The principle,
which ran through and actuated the
whole man—the entire mass of his moral
nature, has been changed, renewed, supplanted.
A new and hitherto unknown
principle has entered the heart, from
which the former occupant has fled abashed.
The ground, formerly overgrown
with the weeds and tares of selfishness,
now brings forth, under divine culture,
the fruits of holiness,—one of the first
of which is supreme love to God, itself
the seed, the germinant principle, the
proof, the pledge, of all the rest.—It may
be said then with perfect truth, that when
a man becomes a Christian, he has a <em>new
God</em>,—a new object of supreme regard,
affection, and veneration. Self formerly
occupied the throne; but self is now upon
the footstool and in the dust that covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
it, while God, his Maker, Redeemer, and
Judge, is enthroned in his rightful supremacy.</p>

<p>The regenerate man is a new creature,
because <em>he has a new rule of duty</em>.</p>

<p>Formerly his own inclination, his own
will, provided there was no outward impediment
which prevented, directed his
actions. Who does not wish to gratify
his own desires? Who would not do it
if he could?</p>

<p>But here is a <em>new creature</em>. The first
question the new born soul puts forth, is
that of Saul, ‘Lord, what <em>wilt thou</em> have
me to do?’ The will of another being,
a being invisible to human eye, impalpable
to human touch, whose literal voice
no man hears, is now the rule of duty to
the new creature. The law of God takes
the place of man’s desires, wishes, and
propensities. He who formerly took
council of his own selfish heart, now yields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to the revealed word; he who once sought
to please himself, now seeks to obey his
heavenly Master; he who followed his
own headlong propensities, now holds
them in check, while he consults the
lively and life-giving oracles of truth.
And these utter no uncertain, ambiguous
responses, but plainly point out the path
of duty, which, to the regenerate man, is
the path of peace.</p>

<p>The unregenerate man, on becoming a
true Christian, exhibits a marked novelty,
a noticeable transformation of character,
in the trait here specified. He puts aside
his old rules of duty, whether they were
his own will, or supposed advantage, or
the maxims of the world; and, in place
of them, adopts God’s law as the standard
by which to estimate his character, mould
his affections, and regulate his conduct.
This is a great change, very great; greater
far than most people imagine.—Reader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Do <em>you</em> know what it implies? Are you
ready to adopt the will of God as your
rule of duty? You must do it, or you can
never be a new creature. Heaven and
hell turn on this pivot. Let God’s will
govern; and holiness, heaven, peace in
life, triumph in death, and joys, which
eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor the
heart of man conceived, are yours. Follow
your own will, in opposition to that
of God, and you shut yourself out from
Heaven, cut yourself off from all holy
affections, and poison the fountains of
life in your soul. You deprive yourself
of all certain present peace, plant thorns
in your dying pillow, and make the final
Judge your eternal enemy, murder hope,
and shut yourself up in the prison of despair.</p>

<p>What can be more proper than that a
creature of yesterday and liable to err,
should look up to his Creator, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from eternity to eternity, and who cannot
err, for instruction and guidance? Would
it be proper that children scarcely out of
the cradle, should follow their short-sighted
and perverse whims, rather than the kind
and wise commands of their experienced
parents? Your child has lived three
years. You have lived thirty. Surely it
is proper that the child of three should
be directed by the parent of thirty years.
And is there no propriety that the creature
of thirty should be directed by the
all wise and eternal Creator? The simple
statement of the subject carries home conviction
to every mind with irresistible force.</p>

<p>Another distinctive trait of the new
creature is, <em>new views of man’s native
character</em>.</p>

<p>The moral, reputable, but impenitent
man, may, by reading, by observation and
reflection, become convinced that something
is wrong about man—very wrong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
He may see that unhesitating truth, and
fearless honesty, and straight forward integrity
are but seldom to be met with.
He may know that pride, and vanity, and
jealousy, and envy, and suspicion, and
anger, weave a large portion of the web
of human life. He may call falsehood
contemptible, and intemperance beastly.
He may acknowledge that laws are necessary
to intimidate, that judges and
courts are required to convict, and that
prisons and penitentiaries are indispensable
to confine the thief and the robber.
All this presents to his mind a dark picture
of human life and character. But
then he contemplates another part of the
picture, and finds some relief. He sees
the kindlier sympathies of our nature discovering
themselves in various forms.
He sees conjugal, parental and filial affection
warm and vigorous in many bosoms,
and the sight is pleasing. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
does not see that the father and mother
and child may all be supremely selfish,
while exhibiting the generous natural affections.
He does not see, at least he is
not apt to see, that all these and similar
principles of human conduct come under
that description of which the Saviour
said, ‘Verily I say unto you, they have
their reward.’ There is no holiness in
them. They do not spring from holiness;
they do not produce holiness.
Who thinks when he sees the red-breast
bearing in its bill food for its young, that
the bird is holy? Yet has it not affection
for its young? Is not the sight pleasant?
Others must have different feelings from
mine, if it be not so. Often have I
watched the efforts and parental solicitude
of the warblers of the woods, and admired
the wisdom of the God of nature, who
feedeth the young ravens when they cry.
Is the fond mother, rocking her sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
infant, and smiling as it smiles, therefore
holy? Is her love to her child necessarily
connected with love to God, and with
penitence for her sins? There are those
that tell us that these natural and kindly
affections, of which, (were we destitute,)
we should be below the very brutes, are
proof and exhibition of holiness! ‘Blind
leaders of the blind!’</p>

<p>But here is a <em>new creature</em>. He sees,
that the most amiable unrenewed men,
in all their moral, accountable exercises,
are sinful, only sinful, and sinful without
any mixture of holiness. Once he did
not believe this. It was a harsh and uncomfortable
view of the human character
and condition. Or if he did believe it,
as a doctrine too plainly revealed to be
doubted, still it was a bare intellectual
assent to a repulsive dogma of revelation.
But now it comes home to his bosom, as a
truth of awful, personal import. ‘I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but
now mine eye seeth thee; wherefore <em>I abhor
myself, and repent in dust and ashes</em>.</p>

<p>Truly, here is a great change. He
who exalted now abases; he who excused
now convicts; he who justified now condemns,
himself. He who rose in opposition
to God’s laws, now rejoices to submit
to them. He who raised objections,
sought out difficulties, and uttered complaints
of injustice and partiality, now
ascribes righteousness to his Maker, and
takes shame to himself. He sees, realizes,
and feels through his whole soul, that the
only difficulty was in an impenitent, selfish,
unhumbled, unholy heart, that, knowing
its Lord’s will, would not do it. The
truly regenerate man knows, by an evidence
of consciousness and personal feeling
equal to demonstration, that the natural
heart is enmity to God. He has
felt this enmity in his own heart, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
knows that, as in a glass face answereth
to face, so does the heart of man to man.</p>

<p>The new creature has <em>a new foundation
for his hope of acceptance with God</em>.</p>

<p>Formerly he was as good as his neighbours.
He was no hypocrite. He did
not make any great pretensions to religion,
it is true, but he was honest in his
dealings, kind to the poor, and ready to
do what he could to relieve the suffering
and deliver the oppressed. Or if his circumstances
did not admit of his really
<em>doing</em> this, he was disposed to do it. Had
he possessed the means, he certainly
should have done it; and he who looketh
on the heart and requires only according
to what a man hath, will readily take the
will for the deed.—Some make a great
merit of their sobriety. They are not
intemperate, not dishonest, not profane,
respect the Sabbath, read their Bibles,
have read them for a long time, attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
meeting regularly:—surely, putting all
this together, their characters must stand
fair, and their hopes be good.</p>

<p>But here is a <em>new creature</em>. He no
longer compares himself with his neighbour.
He examines himself by the law
of God, and he cries ‘Woe is me, for I
am undone; I have broken God’s holy
laws, and there is no health, no strength,
no soundness in me. I am guilty. I am
ruined.’ His honesty, integrity, and
kindness, his attention to the means of
grace, his attendance in the sanctuary,
his reading of God’s word, all his feelings
and actions are now seen to be defiled.
He can no longer look to them for hope.
He turns away from these refuges of lies,
and flies to the hope set before him in the
gospel. He no longer balances his good
deeds against his defective ones. He no
longer attempts to number his benevolent
actions and weigh his holy desires. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
feels that he never did a good deed, not
one; that he never performed a benevolent
action, not one; that he never entertained
a right feeling, not one. In the
light which heaven pours down upon his
book of debt and credit, which he has
been keeping so long, astonished he perceives,
that the sum total of his life stands
against him in characters black with sin.
He despairs of all hope from himself.
His own fancied merit, the idol so long
worshipped, now is a burden of sin that
would sink him to perdition, were there
not outstretched a divine arm to rescue
him from impending ruin, and raise him
to hope and peace. He turns, self-loathing,
to the cross of Christ, and sees that
thereon only can a sinner like him hang
his hope of forgiveness and heaven. It is
the blood of Christ, applied to his accusing
conscience, that alone can calm his agitation,
and speak peace to his troubled soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, then, is a great change. Every
thing else is renounced as a ground of
hope before God, but Christ and his cross.
Truly, the regenerate man is a new creature.
He has a new Saviour. Jesus,
formerly a despised Nazarene, deserving
none of his confidence or love, is now
his Lord and his God. ‘Old things have
passed away; behold, all things have become
new.’</p>

<p>Reader, is it so with you? Is self, or
God, your object of supreme love? Is
your own will, or the will of God, your
rule of duty? Do you think yourself
commendable or abominable in the sight
of God? Do you trust to your own merit
for salvation, or do you see and
deeply feel, that it is only by repentance
for sin, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,
that any can be saved?</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
